Create a MySql database allStudents. What information should the university gather from each student? 10 pieces of useful information are listed below. First create a user interface using an HTML form, and a corresponding table named studentRecords in allStudents. The fields of the table should conform to the fields in the HTML form, which are as follows
1)First name, middle initial, last name [3 varchar fields]
2)Father’s name, mother’s name [2 varchar fields]
3)Date of birth [3 integer fields]
4)Street address [varchar]
5)City, State, Pin [3 varchar fields]
6)Student’s Adhar card number [primary key, 12-digit char field]
7)Student’s email id [varchar]
8)Cell-phone numbers of student, father and mother (or of two guardians) [varchar fields]
9)Major field of study [examples: Physics, Chemstry, Math, English, Hindi, History, Economics, etc.]. These fields will be selected from a single-selection dropdown list.
10)Minor fields of study [examples: Physics, Chemstry, Math, English, Hindi, History, Economics, etc.]. These fields will be selected from a multiple-selection dropdown list.
11)Finally place a Submit button. When this button is clicked, data are retrieved from the form and stored in studentRecords.
Part 1) When the fields have been filled in, clicking the Submit button writes the values of the fields to the table.
Part 2) Write a separate program to retrieve a student’s records when his/her Adhar number is specified
